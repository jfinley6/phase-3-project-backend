# Phase-3-Project Weather App

A blackjack app which allows users to create an account and bet tokens by playing Blackjack. After creating an account you can customize it by changing your user icon. The players with the top 5 most tokens will show up on the leaderboard and incentivize players to try to get the most tokens. You can play the game by betting in amounts of 10, 25, 100, and 500. Clicking the Reset button will reduce your bet amount to 0. Clicking the Place Bet button will start the game. Clicking hit will deal you another card and clicking stand will deal cards to the dealer until either they win or bust. A 21 will always win and aces are always 11. If you get to 17 the dealer will play until they win or bust. If your tokens are 10 or below you can click the Add Tokens button to get 100 more.
